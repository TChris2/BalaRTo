# BalaRTo

To run this you will need to install both Steamodded & Lovely
A guide to install each can be found here https://github.com/Steamodded/smods/wiki

An additional mod required to run this mod is Malverk https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk

# Changes from previous version
- Custom deck skins such as Ladybug's no longer take over an existing skin and instead how their own seperate deck skin to themselves which can be found customize deck at end of their suit.

- The Youtube texture pack which changes the games textures to Youtube has been merged into this mod and can be selected from the textures option, the deck skin which goes along with this texture pack can be found in the customize deck.

# Known Issues 
When changing languages some of the text of deck descriptions do not properly update, this can be fixed by restarting the game, idk why but its an issue with Malverk for some reason and I couldn't figure out how to fix it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
